Hey there! I'm Pierce, a Software Engineer. I earned my Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from The University of Colorado Boulder in May 2023. I was a high achieving student, earning a spot on the Dean's List for 5 of my 6 semesters during my tenure, and earning my place in the CU Esteemed Scholars program.

I fell in love with computers from a young age. My first experiences with technology were from a very young age, with both of my parents working in Information Technology. I started building games on platforms like Roblox in grade school, growing a life-long love for programming.

When I am away from the computer, I am usually bettering myself at the gym, spending time with friends or family, or watching hockey or football!
